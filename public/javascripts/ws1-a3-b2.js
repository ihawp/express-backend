    Apologies for my lack of commenting on the
    first two assignments.

    Original code copied from my ws1-a3-b1.js

    -------------

    NOTE:

    I was never sure if we were meant to
    load the bike slides dynamically...

    The ws1-a3-b2.js does not work on mobile
    view in Inspect Element. I am assuming there
    are some functions that are better suited for
    interactivity in that way..? Is it meant to work
    on mobile?
